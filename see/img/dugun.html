   The form of our letters, the older handwriting and inscriptions as much as
   the cuttings in use today, reflects a convention that has slowly solidified,
   an agreement hardened in many battles. Even after the Renaissance several
   European countries retained broken, blackletter national scripts in opposition to roman, the obligatory type for all Latin material; yet even today, I hope, the last word about Fraktur has not been spoken.

   Apart from that, the roman minuscule has been our way of writing for hundreds
   of years. What followed were merely fashionable variations, here and there even
   deformations, of the noble basic form, but no improvement whatever. The
   punches of Claude Garamond, cut around 1530 in Paris, are simply unsurpassed in
   their clarity, readability and beauty. Garamond appeared on the scene at a
   time when the occidental book, as an object, cast off its medieval
   ponderousness and took up the form which today is still the best: the slender
   and upright rectangular body, comprising folded sheets stitched or sewn at
   the back, in a cover whose protruding edges protect the trimmed pages.
